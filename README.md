## Requirements

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| Android Studio | Ladybug or newer |
| JDK | 21 |
| Gradle | wrapper included |
| Android SDK | Compile SDK 36, Min SDK 26 |

Minimum device: **Android 8.0 (API 26)**
Target: **Android 15 (API 36)**

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/smellouk/shellify.git
cd shellify

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# Build release APK (requires signing config)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The project uses **convention plugins** defined in `build-logic/` — no manual SDK path configuration is required beyond a standard Android Studio setup.

---

## Architecture

Shellify follows **Clean Architecture** with strict layer separation enforced by Konsist at compile time.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Presentation["Presentation — feature:*"]
        screens["Compose Screens · ViewModels"]
    end
    subgraph Infrastructure["Infrastructure — core:*"]
        infra["database · engine · security · backup · crypto\nisolation · pwa · translate · theme · locale\niconpack · shortcut · deeplink · ui"]
    end
    subgraph Domain["Domain — core:domain  ·  Pure Kotlin, no Android deps"]
        domain["Models · Repository Interfaces · Use Cases"]
    end

    Presentation --> Infrastructure
    Presentation --> Domain
    Infrastructure --> Domain
```

- **`core:domain`** — Pure Kotlin (no Android dependency). Defines all models, repository interfaces, and use cases.
- **`core:*`** — Infrastructure modules that implement domain interfaces (database, engine, security, backup, etc.).
- **`feature:*`** — Presentation layer only. Each feature module contains screens and ViewModels; no direct data access.
- **`core:ui`** — Shared design system: composables, typography, spacing tokens, Material 3 theme.

Dependency direction: `feature → core:domain`, `core:* → core:domain`. Feature modules never depend on each other.

| Manual backup | Export to any folder via Android SAF |
| Scheduled backup | Weekly or monthly via WorkManager |
| Cross-device restore | `.pwab` files are portable — restore with the same password on any device |

| Multilingual | English, French, Arabic, Simplified Chinese (runtime switchable) |

---

## Navigation

Navigation uses **Jetpack Compose Navigation**. All routes are defined in `Screen.kt`; the graph is assembled in `AppNavigation.kt`.

**Start destination logic:**

```
consent not given           →  ConsentScreen
onboarding not done         →  OnboardingScreen
whatsNewVersion outdated    →  WhatsNewScreen
otherwise                   →  HomeScreen
```

Bottom navigation (Home, Categories, Shortcuts, Settings) is only visible on top-level routes.

---

## Deep Linking

Two URI schemes are registered for importing app configurations:

| Scheme | Example |
|---|---|
| Custom | `shellify://add?url=<base64url-encoded-https-url>&name=<app-name>` |
| HTTPS | `https://shellify.app/add?url=<base64url-encoded-https-url>&name=<app-name>` |

The URL parameter must be **Base64url-encoded** (no padding) and must decode to an `https://` URL — HTTP is rejected.

A confirmation dialog showing the destination host is displayed before any app is added.

**Test with ADB:**

```bash
# Encode a URL
ENCODED=$(printf '%s' "https://youtube.com" | base64 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')

# Fire the deep link
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "shellify://add?url=${ENCODED}&name=YouTube" \
  io.shellify.app
```

---

## Backup

Backup files use the `.pwab` extension (an encrypted ZIP archive).

- **Encryption:** Argon2id key derivation → AES-256-GCM cipher
- **Contents:** Database dump, icons, settings, cookies (re-encrypted into archive), WebView profiles (Android 13+)
- **Excluded:** App password hash, database passphrase, backup password — all device-specific secrets are never exported
- **Storage:** User-selected folder via Android Storage Access Framework (SAF)
- **Schedule:** Manual, weekly, or monthly via WorkManager
- **Cross-device:** `.pwab` files are portable — restore on any device using the same password

---

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests — includes Konsist architecture checks
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Screenshot regression tests
./gradlew verifyRoborazziDebug

# Instrumented tests (requires connected device or emulator)
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest

# Full local check suite
./gradlew detekt lintDebug testDebugUnitTest
```

| Layer | Framework |
|---|---|
| Unit tests | JUnit 4 + MockK |
| Compose UI tests | Compose UI Test (JUnit4 rule) |
| Screenshot tests | Roborazzi (Robolectric runner) — golden images committed alongside UI changes |
| Architecture tests | Konsist — enforces Clean Architecture layer boundaries |
| Database tests | Room in-memory database |

Instrumented smoke tests cover navigation, consent gate, deep-link dialogs, and key screens end-to-end.

### Developer Tools

`docs/tools.html` is a single-page in-app test harness for manual feature testing. Serve it locally and load it inside Shellify:

```bash
# Tunnel host port 8080 to the device
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080

# Serve the docs folder (Python)
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory docs
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/tools.html` as a Shellify web app. Available tabs:

| Tab | What it tests |
|---|---|
| **Chrome Tools** | `ShellifyBridge` Java interface — direct notification dispatch, rate limit, and truncation via the Chromium WebView |
| **GeckoView Tools** | Web `Notification` API via Gecko — permission flow, foreground fire, and 10-second background timer |

---

## Code Quality

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Detekt** | Static analysis + ktlint formatting; config in `config/detekt/detekt.yml` |
| **Android Lint** | Resource, accessibility, and API-level checks; config in `config/lint/lint.xml` |
| **Konsist** | Architecture consistency — fails the build if layer rules are violated |

```bash
# Run Detekt
./gradlew detekt

# Run Lint
./gradlew lintDebug
```

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Library |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Navigation | Navigation Compose |
| Database | Room + SQLCipher |
| Preferences | DataStore |
| Networking | OkHttp |
| Image loading | Coil (+ SVG) |
| Browser engine | System WebView + GeckoView (optional) |
| Tor | Guardian Project `tor-android` + `jtorctl` |
| QR codes | ZXing Core |
| Biometrics | AndroidX Biometric |
| Background work | WorkManager |
| DI | Manual (ViewModel factories, no framework) |
| Build | AGP + KSP |

---

## Roadmap

See [`.planning/ROADMAP.md`](.planning/ROADMAP.md) for the full phase breakdown. Active milestone: **v2 — Privacy-First Feature Parity**.

---

## Localization

Three languages are supported at runtime, switchable from the onboarding screen or settings:

| Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | English (default) |
| `fr` | French |
| `ar` | Arabic |

String resources live in `core/ui/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (canonical English) and mirrored to `app/src/main/res/values-fr/` and `app/src/main/res/values-ar/`.

---

## Privacy

Shellify is local-first. No account, no cloud sync, no analytics, no crash reporting.

The only outbound network calls are:

- Favicon fetch from the user's chosen domain
- PWA manifest detection from the user's chosen domain
- Optional Simple Icons library download (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`)
- Optional GeckoView engine download (`maven.mozilla.org`), user-initiated
- Translation requests (`translate.googleapis.com`), only when translation is enabled for an app
